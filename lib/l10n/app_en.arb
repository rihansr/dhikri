  "masala": "-\tThe time of Morning Dhikr starts from early dawn, continuing it till the sunrise. However, one can continue it till the salah of dhuhr according to many scholars.\n\n-\tThe dikhr of afternoon is better to be conducted after salah of asr till maghrib. However, there is no issue doing it after maghrib.\n\n-\tThese Dhikr can be performed in the leisure of morning and evening duties (worldly).\n\n-\tThere is no prohibition of performing such dhikr for women without ablution (wudhu) or headcover.\n\n-\tThe dhikr can be performed during the menstrual cycle or postpartum or even in states of impurity (when ghusl is obligatory) according to the opinion of most scholars.\n\nAbove all, Allah knows the best."
